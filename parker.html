                <h2>About Mission</h2>
                <p>Launch: The Parker Solar Probe was launched on August 12, 2018, aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
                    Closest Approach: The probe gets closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft, flying through the Sun's corona, reaching distances as close as 4 million miles from the Sun's surface.
                    Named After: Named after Dr. Eugene Parker, who proposed the existence of solar wind in the 1950s, the Parker Solar Probe aims to explore the region where solar winds are accelerated</p>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Mission Objectives </h2>
                <p> Understand Solar Wind: Investigate the mechanisms that accelerate and transport solar wind and explore its structure and dynamics.
                    Study Solar Corona: Examine the Sun's outer atmosphere to understand the processes that heat it and accelerate the solar wind.
                    Explore Magnetic Fields: Investigate the magnetic fields around the Sun and how they influence solar wind and the Sun's atmosphere.
                    Predict Space Weather: Improve our ability to forecast changes in space weather and understand their impacts on Earth and other planets.</p>

                <h2>Major Findings</h2>
                <p>Solar Wind Origin: Confirmed the existence of previously hypothesized "switchbacks" in the solar wind - sudden reversals in the magnetic field direction, providing clues about the origins of solar wind.
                    Solar Wind Speed: Measured solar wind speeds much higher than predicted, indicating the need for further study on the mechanisms that accelerate solar wind.
                    Coronal Heating: Observed structures in the corona that might be responsible for heating it to temperatures much higher than the solar surface.
                    Magnetic Field Structure: Provided insights into the complex and dynamic magnetic field structures near the Sun, including the discovery of magnetic islands and switchbacks.
                    Space Weather Impact: Contributed to our understanding of space weather and its potential impacts on technology and human activities in space.</p>
