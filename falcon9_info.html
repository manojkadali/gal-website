                <h2>About Mission</h2>
                <p>Falcon 9 is a partially reusable rocket, with the first stage designed to return to Earth for reuse, significantly reducing launch costs. The rocket features nine Merlin engines on its first stage and a single Merlin engine on its second stage.
                    Variants: There are several variants of Falcon 9, including the Block 5 version, which is the latest iteration and features improvements in reusability, performance, and reliability.
                       Reusability: One of the key innovations of Falcon 9 is its reusability. After launch, the first stage of the rocket can autonomously return to Earth and land vertically on a drone ship or landing pad, ready to be refurbished and flown again.</p>
