                <h2>About Mission</h2>
                <p>Design: Dragon is a spacecraft developed by SpaceX to transport cargo and crew to and from space. It consists of two variants: Cargo Dragon (Dragon 1) and Crew Dragon (Dragon 2). Dragon features a pressurized capsule capable of carrying cargo or crew and a trunk section for unpressurized cargo.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Mission Objectives </h2>
                <p>Cargo Dragon (Dragon 1): Originally designed to transport cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, Cargo Dragon has completed multiple resupply missions to the ISS.
                      Crew Dragon (Dragon 2): Designed for crewed missions, Crew Dragon is capable of carrying astronauts to and from the ISS. It features an upgraded design with advanced life support systems, touchscreen controls, and emergency escape capabilities.
                           Reusability:Both variants of Dragon are designed for reusability. They are capable of docking autonomously with the ISS and returning safely to Earth, where they can be refurbished and flown again for future missions.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Major Findings</h2>
                <p>Historic Crewed Missions: Crew Dragon made history with its first crewed flight, Demo-2, in May 2020, which marked the first crewed orbital launch from U.S. soil since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011.
                        Operational Success: Both Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon have demonstrated operational success, with multiple successful missions to and from the ISS, showcasing the reliability and capabilities of SpaceX's spacecraft.
                            Reusability Benefits: Dragon's reusability has contributed to cost savings and increased access to space by enabling multiple missions with the same spacecraft. This has significant implications for the future of space transportation.
                                  Commercial Viability: Dragon's success has solidified SpaceX's position as a leading provider of commercial space services, with contracts from NASA and other customers for both cargo and crew transportation services.</p>
